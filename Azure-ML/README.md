# Azure-AutoML
Azure AutoML has greatly simplified machine learning thereby putting more emphasis on understanding results produced by machine learning experiment. 
Before now, executing a machine learning code is usually characterize by a cumbersome coding and transformation process but with automl, 
once you understand your data and possibly doing some mild transformations before feeding it into automl, the processing of transformations and executing
the task is automatically done.
