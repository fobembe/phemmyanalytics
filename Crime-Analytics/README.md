# Community_Crime_Analytics
This project examined the determinants of crimes in US communities.  The dataset contains over 2000 records and over 100 features.  We extracted 29 features that we felt can strongly trigger crimes in the communities.  Again, some of the features were measured with more than 1 variables, hence, we selected only 1 from where multiple variables were provided.
