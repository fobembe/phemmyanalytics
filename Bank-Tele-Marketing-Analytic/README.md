# Bank-Telemarketing-Campaign

This project seeks to understand the most important factors influencing the success of a Telemarketing campaign among its customers.  The importance of this project is to guide the bank in targeting customers that are most likely going to subscribe to their term-deposit product.  Analyzing the past purchase behaviors of existing customers can go a long way in mapping out existing customers that can be targeted by the marketing department.  This way, advertising expenditure is optimized.
